As the name of this file says, these are easy problems:


TEX Quotes: Find pairs of "" and replace then with `` to open, and '' to close. Don't look for nested quotes, just replace then in a first come first serve fashion.

Cost Cutting: Compare three numbers, and assign the middle number and the one to keep.
